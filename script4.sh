# Script 4: Log File Analyzer
# Author: Shurti Sharma | Roll: 24BAI10529
# Course: Open Source Software
# Purpose: Reads a log file line by line, counts keyword
#          occurrences and prints matching lines

# --- Command line arguments ---
# $1 is the first argument passed when running the script
# $2 is the second argument (optional keyword, default is "error")
LOGFILE=$1
KEYWORD=${2:-"error"}

# Counter variable to track how many matches found
COUNT=0
