## About This Project

This project is a structured audit of Git — one of the most
widely used open source tools in the world. Git was created
by Linus Torvalds in 2005 after a proprietary version control
tool revoked its free license. Rather than pay for an
alternative, Torvalds built his own and gave it to the world
for free under the GPL v2 license.

This audit covers Git's origin story, its license and the
freedoms it grants, its ethical implications, how it lives
on a Linux system, its ecosystem, and a comparison with its
proprietary alternative Perforce.

## Shell Scripts

### Script 1 — System Identity Report
**File:** `script1.sh`
**What it does:** Displays information about the Linux system
including the kernel version, logged in user, uptime, date,
and the license of the operating system and chosen software.
**Concepts used:** Variables, echo, command substitution $()

### Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector
**File:** `script2.sh`
**What it does:** Checks whether Git is installed on the system,
displays its version, size, and summary, then uses a case
statement to print a philosophy note about Git's origin.
**Concepts used:** if-else, case statement, dpkg, grep, pipe

### Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor
**File:** `script3.sh`
**What it does:** Loops through important system directories
and reports their permissions, owner, group, and disk usage.
Also checks Git's configuration file locations specifically.
**Concepts used:** for loop, ls, du, awk, if-else, arrays

### Script 4 — Log File Analyzer
**File:** `script4.sh`
**What it does:** Reads a log file line by line, counts how
many times a keyword appears, and prints the last 5 matching
lines. Defaults to /var/log/dpkg.log if no file is specified.
**Concepts used:** while read loop, if-else, counter variables,
command line arguments, grep, tail

### Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator
**File:** `script5.sh`
**What it does:** Asks the user three interactive questions
and generates a personalised open source philosophy statement,
saving it to a .txt file named after the current user.
**Concepts used:** read, string concatenation, file writing
with > and >>, date command, cat
